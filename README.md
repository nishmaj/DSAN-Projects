# Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree

This repository contains the projects for  Data Structure and Algorithms Nanodegree Program from Udacity.

## Project 1

### Unscramble CS Problems
Complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016
Use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset
Perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.

## Project 2

### Data Structures: implement appropriate data structures and corresponding methods

Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache
File Recursion
Huffman Coding
Active Directory
Blockchain
Union and Intersection

In separate text file, write explanation for using given data structure and explain the time and speed efficiency for each solution.


## Project 3

### Problems vs. Algorithms

Square Root of an Integer
Search in a Rotated, Sorted Array
Rearrange Array Digits
Dutch National Flag Problem
Autocomplete with Tries
Unsorted Integer Array
Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

### Advanced Algorithms

Greedy Algorithms
Graph Algorithms
Dynamic Programming
A-Star (A*) Algorithm

In separate text file, write explanation for using given data structure/algoritham and explain the time and speed efficiency for each solution.


## Project 4
A* Algorithm to create a route planner.
